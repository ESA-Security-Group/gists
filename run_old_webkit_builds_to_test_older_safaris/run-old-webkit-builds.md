After `cray cray` amounts of testing, I found the easiest solution is to use a portable install of Chromium 30, which comes very close to Safari 7, in terms of quirks.

Then use a service like browser stack or sauce labs to spot check that work.

Here is the Chromium 30 I use on a Mac:

I also use the WPG detect browser plugin for wordpress that gives you version specific classes in the body tag:
